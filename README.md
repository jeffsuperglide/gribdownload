# gribdownload
Python script to download QPE, QPF, and HRRR GRIB files from NOAA websites.

gribdownload was written in Python 2.7 to allow integration into CWMS/RTS CAVI.

The included shebang (#!) is set to a USACE installed ArcGIS version.
The user should review their available Python installation(s) to determine the
best way for them to run this script.  For USACE users, the shebang (#!) can point
to jython.exe in the CWMS CAVI installation using the FQPN.

For list of options:

gribdownload -h or --help
